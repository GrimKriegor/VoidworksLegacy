Voidworks' development was both made possible and greatly sped up, by the contributions of the following entities.


# x36Granitplate

Great source of inspiration as well as DS3 knowledge.

Voidworks was developed alongside x36's own personal project of similar nature and a lot of intel was shared in the process.

This project would have never happened were it not for this partnership.

# Aaron

Huge source of DS3 specific and reverse engineering knowledge which helped kickstart this project.

[DS3DebugFPS](https://github.com/0dm/DS3DebugFPS/), released under the Apache-2.0 license, is the basis for the whole DLL wrapping method, as well as most window related functionality.

# Amir and Pyre

Shared DS3 specific knowledge and provided copious amounts of inspiration.

It was through reverse engineering their public mods that the anti-cheat bypass method was found.

# Igromanru and the public table maintainers

The [public table](https://github.com/igromanru/Dark-Souls-III-Cheat-Engine-Guide) for CE remains the number one source for basic knowledge, memory addresses and methods.

This project's ParamPatcher implementation is heavily based on Igro's work.

# Many other reverse engineers and script writers

Everyone who went to the trouble of reverse engineering a part of the game and releasing a script or piece of documentation, which inspired a feature in Voidworks.
